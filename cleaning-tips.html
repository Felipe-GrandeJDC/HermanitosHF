<p>In a world that is becoming increasingly more virtual, it is comforting to know that something as real as a Harley-Davidson速 motorcycle still exists. Not only can you see it, but you can smell it, feel it and taste it. Iron. Chrome. Leather.</p> <p>Maybe that is why we spend so much time cleaning our motorcycles. It is not enough just to ride them. We want to feel every fender&#39;s curve, every bolt&#39;s hard edge, and memorize the sensation. This is a feeling you cannot get by surfing the Net or by playing a DVD.</p> <p>Despite these intentions, you can actually damage your motorcycle if you don&#39;t clean it in the proper way. Dirty rags, harsh detergents and neglected areas can cause scratching, dulling and, yes, galvanic corrosion. More about that later.</p> <p>Keeping a clean motorcycle, however, is crucial to the long-term well-being and value of your Harley速 bike. A clean bike is easier to maintain, cheaper to operate and more likely to maintain its value. And it makes your Harley-Davidson速 motorcycle look as good as it should. The key is to clean it properly.</p> <h3> Here's how to do it: </h3>

<h3> Let Us Do It For You </h3> <p> Don't have time? </p><p> Need the bike for the weekend and want it ready to ride on your day off instead of having to groom and get it ready? </p><p> We can do it for you! </p><p> Call today and make an appointment with our service department. </p>

<h3>Pre-wash</h3> <p>Before you turn on the hose and crack open the S100 total cycle cleaner, remember to do some simple things that can make a huge difference and help you avoid dreaded scratching:</p> <ul> <li>Remove rings, jewelry, watches and anything else that might scratch your bike as you clean. Motorcycle jackets with metal buckles, zippers and studs can be especially dangerous.</li> <li>Keep your bike in the shade and don't try to wash it right after a long ride. Not only can a hot engine and pipes burn you, but they can scar your motorcycle by making waxes and cleaners act differently.</li> <li>If your bike is caked with mud or heavy soil, rinse it off first. Sponging over crusted dirt can scratch your paint.</li> <li>Beware the old sponge -- it may have dirt that scratches trapped inside. Also, if you use new terry towels for drying, make sure you wash them first, but don't use fabric softeners.</li> <li>If you use a soft bristle brush or paint brush for fine detailing, tape over the metal parts to avoid scratching.</li> <li>Buy cleaning products made for cleaning motorcycles. Just because something makes your bathtub or toaster shine, doesn't mean it will do the same for your Harley速 motorcycle.</li> </ul> <h3>The Wash</h3> <ul> <li>Now that you're ready, it's time to roll up your sleeves and get to work.</li> <li>Apply the cleaning agent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Remember, they do this for a living, so their advice is pretty good.</li> <li>Rinse thoroughly from the top down, paying careful attention to complete removal of cleaner, especially from nooks and crannies.</li> <li>*During rinsing, you may splatter cleaner from one part of the bike to another, so go back and give the bike a light misting.</li> <li>If you use a high-pressure washer, like those found at do-it-yourself car washes, keep the nozzle away from sensitive areas like chain links, bearings, cables, electronics and electrics.</li> <li>In drying your bike, pay close attention to areas where water tends to puddle.</li> <li>If you dry the bike with a terry cloth towel, make sure it is pre-washed and free of fabric softeners.</li> <li>If you use compressed air, make sure the tank is clean and that it has a clean filter. Drying with a dirty compressor is like sandblasting your bike.</li> <li>Leaf blowers make excellent bike dryers. Again, make certain the blower is clean.</li> <li>Clean your wheels -- this is the galvanic corrosion part. In the course of normal use, carbon and metal particles from brake dust are shot at your wheels at a high velocity. If neglected, these unlike metals can react to one another -- galvanic corrosion -- creating star-shaped pitting on your wheels. The result is costly refinishing of the wheel. In other words, wheel dirt is a whole new kind of dirt -- so it needs a whole new kind of cleaner. Look for a cleaner made specifically for wheels, preferably one that is pH balanced such as S100's wheel cleaner.</li> </ul> <h3>The Once Over</h3> <ul> <li>As you clean and rinse your bike, be very aware of how water reacts. This will give you an indication of what to do next.</li> <li>If the water beads into small round droplets, you probably don't need to wax or polish your bike.</li> <li>If the water sheets or forms oblong droplets, it may be time for a wax job.</li> <li>If your bike is older than six months, professional detailers recommend a pre-cleaning or cleansing. Use gentle polishing agents to deal with imperfections, slight scratches, dulling and stains that would otherwise just be covered over with wax. If you don't pre-clean, the wax's ability to develop a high gloss will be diminished.</li> </ul>

<h3> The Wax and Seal</h3> <ul > <li> Waxing isn't just about good looks. A well-waxed bike repels dust, dirt, bugs and dirty water.</li> <li> Choose a wax that is easy to use and follow the manufacturer's instructions.</li> <li> Don't wax in bright sunlight or if the air is especially humid.</li> <li> Use a slightly dampened sponge for application.</li> <li> Soft cloths are an absolute must for rub-out.</li> <li> If streaking occurs, try a dampened cloth or a couple of drops of distilled water in a gentle circular motion. If streaking is severe, reapply a small amount of the wax and remove quickly. If this fails, re-treat the surface with pre-cleaner and re-wax.</li> <li> After waxing, let the bike remain in the shade for several hours if possible.</li> </ul> <h3> You are all set</h3> <ul class="innerBullet "> <li> Now don't just stand there and look at your bike. Get out there and ride with pride. Because having a clean motorcycle is great, but the best part is getting it dirty all over again.</li> </ul>
